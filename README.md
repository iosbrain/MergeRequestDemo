# MergeRequestDemo
An Xcode project, written in Swift, meant to demonstrate a Git "merge request." 

According to [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests):

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
